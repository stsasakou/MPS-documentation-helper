I'm actually pretty confident that you have already discovered such surprises during your experiments. Code in MPS is not text, but instead it is a projection of the abstract syntax (AST). This gives several benefits to language designers and, at the same time, makes the editing experience slightly different and more-restrictive than in the commonplace text editors. This may or may not be considered to be an advantage, nevertheless, there is a learning curve to projectional editing. In general, in projectional code you more rely on the assistance of the editor. Code-completion, block selection and intention actions should become your close friends in order to become an efficient projectional coder. There's a good and a bad side to it:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-4kv83i_86"><li class="list__item" id="-4kv83i_87"><p>good - in less than a week of programming in the MPS editor people typically get back to their full speed of coding they experienced before in text-based IDEs</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-4kv83i_88"><p>bad - projectional editing is highly addictive and you may find text-based editors less compelling and less helpful than you thought they'd been before</p></li></ul><aside class="prompt" data-type="tip" data-title="" id="-4kv83i_89"><p id="-4kv83i_90">We summarized the core essential tips on how to leverage the projectional editor.
