How are they different from "real" programming languages?</h3><p id="i961frj_2">A DSL is a language optimized for a specific problem domain. It is usually less complex than a general-purpose language, such as Java, C, or Ruby. DSLs are typically developed in close coordination with the experts in the domain, or field, for which the DSL is being designed.</p><p id="i961frj_3">In many cases, a DSL is intended to be used by non-programmers who are fluent in the domain the DSL targets. This means the language's notation and tool support should be optimized for non-programmers, so they only see elements and language aspects that are relevant to their domain, also known as Subject Matter Expert (SME).</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="benefits-of-dsl" data-toc="benefits-of-dsl">What are the benefits of using a DSL compared with a regular programming language?</h3><p id="i961frj_4">The benefits of using DSLs are numerous.</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="i961frj_5"><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_6"><p>The end-user of the DSL becomes more efficient at working with their domain, because the level of abstraction is higher and they have to understand only the domain-specific part of the system â not the whole system.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_7"><p>If you are generating source code from your DSL program (as opposed to having it interpreted), you can use nice domain-specific abstractions without paying any runtime overhead. This is because the generator, just like a compiler, can remove the abstractions and generate efficient code.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_8"><p>A DSL allows you to separate essential elements of the domain from the complexity of the code. This improves the communication between the domain experts and the programmers.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_9"><p>Using DSLs and an execution engine makes the application logic expressed in the DSL code independent of the target platform.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_10"><p>Using DSLs can improve code quality, including having fewer bugs, better architectural conformance, and easy-to-maintain code. This is the result of limiting the user to modifying only certain components of the code, as well as the avoidance of duplication in code and the automation of repetitive work. In contrast to libraries and frameworks, DSLs can come with tooling support. Code completion, visualizations, debuggers, simulators and other niceties can be provided to improve the user experience.</p></li></ul></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="dsl-and-regular-code" data-toc="dsl-and-regular-code">How do DSLs and regular code fit together?</h3><p id="i961frj_11">There are two fundamentally different ways of how traditional code and DSL code can be integrated, which are known as Internal and External DSLs. MPS supports both approaches.</p><section class="chapter"><h4 id="externaldsl" data-toc="externaldsl">External DSL:</h4><p id="i961frj_12">The external way keeps DSL code and regular code in separate files. The DSL code is then transformed into programming language code by a code generator, or alternatively the program loads the domain-specific code and executes it. Think of SQL as an example of an external DSL.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="internaldsl" data-toc="internaldsl">Internal DSL:</h4><p id="i961frj_13">The internal approach mixes both types of code in the same program file, leading to much tighter integration between DSL code and programming language code. The DSL reuses the grammar and the parser of the GPL (general-purpose language) and exploits the available extension options of the host language. It is worth mentioning that some GPLs are more suitable for extension than others.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="whatislanguageorientedprogramming" data-toc="whatislanguageorientedprogramming">What is Language-Oriented Programming?</h3><p id="i961frj_14">The term language-oriented programming was coined by Sergey Dmitriev, the CEO of JetBrains and the founding father of MPS, in his 2004 article <a href="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/mps/docs/Language_Oriented_Programming.pdf" id="i961frj_15" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Language Oriented Programming: The Next Programming Paradigm</a>. Other related approaches include Charles Simonyiâs Intentional Programming, and Martin Fowlerâs approach described in his 2005 article <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html" id="i961frj_16" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Language Workbenches: The Killer-App for Domain Specific Languages?</a></p><p id="i961frj_17">The core idea is that we don't always use the same language when developing software, but choose one that fits each specific task best. In contrast to polyglot programming, which on the surface advocates a similar approach, language-oriented programming explicitly encourages developers to build their own DSLs, or to extend existing languages with domain-specific concepts as part of the approach. Developing a new language should become an integral part of software development. To make this feasible, language workbenches such as MPS are an important ingredient of the language-oriented approach.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="whyextendalanguagearentlibrariesgoodenough" data-toc="whyextendalanguagearentlibrariesgoodenough">Why extend a language? Aren't libraries good enough?</h3><p id="i961frj_18">There are a couple of differences between a library and a language extension.</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="i961frj_19"><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_20"><p>A language extension can come with its own syntax. With MPS's projectional editor, this syntax can be arbitrary and is not at all limited by the syntax of the extended language.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_21"><p>A language extension comes with its own constraints and type system, so your IDE can report errors statically.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_22"><p>Language extensions made with MPS are fully integrated into the IDE, so you get code completion, syntax highlighting, and refactoring support for your new language constructs.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_23"><p>A language extension is executed by compile-time transformation and translated into the target programming language code, so there is no runtime overhead that reflection or stacks of indirections would impose. This may be of particular importance when targeting resource-constrained systems.</p></li></ul></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="projectionalediting" data-toc="projectionalediting">Projectional Editing</h3><section class="chapter"><h4 id="whatisprojectionalediting" data-toc="whatisprojectionalediting">What is Projectional Editing?</h4><p id="i961frj_24">In parser-based approaches, users use text editors to enter character sequences that represent programs. A parser then checks the program for syntactic correctness and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the character sequence. The AST contains all the semantic information expressed by the program, meaning that keywords and purely syntactic aspects are omitted.</p><p id="i961frj_25">In projectional editors, the process happens the other way round: as a user edits the program, the AST is modified directly. This is similar to the MVC pattern where every editing action triggers a change in the AST. A projection engine then creates some representation of the AST for the user to interact with. This approach is well-known from various graphical editors. When editing a UML diagram, for example, users don't draw pixels onto a canvas for an "image parser" to read the drawing, parse it, and then create the AST. That would be way too limiting on what you could draw so that the engine would understand. Rather, the editor creates an instance of Class as you drag a class from the palette to the canvas. A projection engine renders the diagram, in this case drawing a rectangle for the class. You can then rearrange visual elements on the screen without changing the meaning of your diagram.</p><p id="i961frj_26">This approach can be generalized to also work with text editors. Every program element is stored as a node with a unique ID (UID) in the AST. References are based on actual pointers (references to UIDs). The AST is actually an Abstract Syntax Graph (AGT) because cross-references are first-class rather than being resolved after parsing. The program is then persisted to disk as XML, but this process is transparent to the user.</p><div class="video-player" id="i961frj_27"><object class="article__bordered-element" width="800" height="451" data-theme="light" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://www.youtube.com/v/iN2PflvXUqQ?color2=FBE9EC&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;version=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1"></object></div></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="why-projectional-editing" data-toc="why-projectional-editing">Why use Projectional Editing? Aren't text editors good enough?</h4><p id="i961frj_28">Since no parsing is used in projectional editors, notations other than text can be used in the editor, such as graphs, math notations, diagrams, and forms. Since these non-textual notations are handled the same way as the textual ones, they can be mixed easily: tables can be embedded into a textual source, and textual languages can be used within table cells. Textual notations can also be used inside boxes or as connection labels in diagrams.</p><p id="i961frj_29">If different languages are combined, the resulting language may become ambiguous in parser-based systems since most grammar formalisms are not closed under composition. In projectional systems, this cannot happen. Any combination of languages will be syntactically valid (though semantics is a different issue).</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="projectional-editor-benefits" data-toc="projectional-editor-benefits">What are the key benefits of using projectional editors instead of parsed languages?</h4><p id="i961frj_30">A projectional editor gives the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) a prominent role in code manipulation. Code is persisted, versioned, refactored, and edited in the AST form, which eliminates the need for repetitive text-to-model-and-back transformations. AST is a much richer representation of code, which avoids ambiguities. The AST can be projected on the screen for editing in any way the language designer desires. With projectional editors, your languages can:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="i961frj_31"><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_32"><p>Allow for non-parseable notations â so that tables, images, and GUI components may become part of the language syntax. The AST can easily accommodate for such language elements, and the projectional editor can draw any graphical shapes on the screen if needed.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_33"><p>Combine multiple languages, potentially developed by different vendors, in a single piece of code. Ambiguities that parsers might not be able to resolve are not an issue for projectional editors.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_34"><p>Handle context-sensitive and positional grammars.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_35"><p>Provide form-like notations â when targeting non-professional developers and domain experts, the preference is usually to use languages that offer a strict notation with a clear indication of the "moving" parts where the user is supposed to provide a value.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_36"><p>Offer multiple notations for a single language â users can view and edit the same piece of code using several different editors, each suitable for a different task. Some editors may use graphical or tabular notations, some may show extra information from other sources, while others may reduce the amount of visual clutter; and yet all can be tied to the same piece of code (AST). The developer can thus choose the best visualization of the code for the given task.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="i961frj_37"><p>Use diagramming notations in combination with text â think of electrical circuits, for example, modeled as graphical schemes with embedded pieces of code attributed to individual elements of the scheme.</p></li></ul></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="integration-with-version-control" data-toc="integration-with-version-control">If it isn't text, how does the integration with version control work? Can I merge versions or show the difference between files?</h4><p id="i961frj_38">Special support is needed for infrastructure integration. Since the concrete syntax is not pure text, a generic persistence format must be used. Therefore, special tools need to be provided for diff and merge features. MPS provides integration with version control systems, such as SVN or Git, and handles diff and merge functionality in the tool, using concrete projected syntax. Note that since every program element has a UUID, a move can be distinguished from delete/create, which provides more usable semantics for diff and merge. The picture below shows how the VCS in MPS looks like.</p><figure id="i961frj_39"><img alt="mps vcs" src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2024.1/mps-diff.png" title="mps vcs" width="634" height="387"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="how-long-to-get-editor" data-toc="how-long-to-get-editor">How long does it take to get used to the projectional editor?</h4><p id="i961frj_40">Using the MPS projectional editor for the first time can feel odd because it is different from a textual editor. Our extensive UX research has shown that it takes a few days for most users to become accustomed to the projectional editor and feel no discomfort. In fact, many users have claimed they prefer the MPS way of editing things, since in many contexts you're selecting elements based on the syntax tree anyway.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="mpsspecifics" data-toc="mpsspecifics">MPS Specifics</h3><section class="chapter"><h4 id="howismpslicensed" data-toc="howismpslicensed">How is MPS licensed?</h4><p id="i961frj_41">MPS is an open-source product under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html" id="i961frj_42" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache 2.0 License</a>.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="howcaniquicklygetstartedwithmps" data-toc="howcaniquicklygetstartedwithmps">How can I quickly get started with MPS?</h4><p id="i961frj_43">We recommend getting started with our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/fast-track-to-mps.html" id="i961frj_44" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Track Tutorial</a> and for a quick introduction to MPS, try our <a href="https://cogniterra.org/course/28" id="i961frj_45" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quickstart tutorial</a>.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="howactiveisthecommunity" data-toc="howactiveisthecommunity">How active is the community?</h4><p id="i961frj_46">The community is small compared to those of other technologies, but itâs very active.
